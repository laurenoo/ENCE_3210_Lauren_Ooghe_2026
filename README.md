Lab 1 - Q7 --> Used ChatGPT to figure out how to attack the problem. Learned different ways to execute the code, and decided the best way was to create functions to invoke to keep the code semi-clean inside of the void loop. Did not copy/paste, just mimicked layout of different versions. Also learned how to use switch() function with cases. This helps workload so I don't have to write as many if statements and is more versatile and not hard-coded. Willing to explain method of thinking and understanding of the code.
