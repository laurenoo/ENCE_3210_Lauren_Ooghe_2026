4-bit DAC was created on the breadboard to simulate output response to a given digital input. 
The ramp.ino file was created using ChatGPT due to limited time and understanding of the design. I would like to try to build a 10-bit DAC and 
measure the output to get a smooth continuous output without clipping. In order to prevent clipping, I need to figure out the appropriate resistor
values needed for the DC offset on the op-amp.


KiCad files were added. The layout is determined, but also subject to change due to dependance on tracing practices.
